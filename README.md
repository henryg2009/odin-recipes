Description:

This is my first Project for HTML Foundations.

It has been quite a challenge and I believe I've learned all the necessary steps to at least format something legible.

I've worked on:
    1. Elements and Tags
    2. HTML Boilerplate
    3. Text, Heading, Body, and Title
    4. Unordered and Ordered Lists
    5. How to link absolute and relative links
    6. Display images download, as well as format size.
    7. Commit messages for changes.

I'm excited to see where this will go.
