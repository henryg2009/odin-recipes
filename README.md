Description:

This is my first Project for HTML Foundations which will display 3 of my favorite recipes where I will include a webpage with links and pictures.

It has been quite a challenge and I believe I've learned all the necessary steps to at least format something legible.

I've worked on: Elements and Tags; HTML Boilerplate; Text, Heading, Body, and Title; Unordered and Ordered Lists; How to link absolute and relative links; Display images download, as well as format size; Commit messages for changes.

I'm excited to see where this will go.
